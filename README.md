“In the UK, many households waste a significant portion of their food costs due to poor planning, lack of culinary ideas, and poor use of leftovers. There is no current solution that solves these problems simultaneously. 
Our challenge is to make an easy-to-use app to helps users manage their food consumption, reduce waste and save money.”
